Personal Implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

NOTE:
**Requires ffmpeg**

Installation:

Either run the makefile or compile the c file how you see fit.
May need some modification to run on Windows (directories specifically).

Usage:

Running the binary with no options should print to console what options it needs.
Should be fairly self-explanatory.
